availability of the blood. This application provides the required information in no time and also
helps to make the quick decision making. Our application has 6 screens which is quite simple to
the user to access. The first page will be the login page where he can access our application by
signing in with the username and password which helps to keep track of the anonymous user. If
the user is using the application for the first time, he can register with the register page where he
can give his details like name, age, address, gender and the blood group. Once the user logged in,
he/she can get the information about the donor’s list of particular blood group in the Donor’s
page. If the user searching for the number of blood units available in the blood bank, he/she can
access that data in the blood bank page. If user willing to be a donor or change his details he/she
can do using the edit page.
